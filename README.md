# The DMV
### Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. 
### What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.
*I made a chart of sorts on my whiteboard by opening up each of the class files and writing down the state and behavior 
already present in each. For each of the methods that was already defined, I read through line by line to understand 
what it was doing. I took note of the data types of each attribute, and noted with what parameters each class object was 
instantiated.*
### What was hard about working with code you did not write?
*Nothing... yet.* 
### What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?
*Drawing a chart of the codebase already present was a lot easier than the first time around. Also easier than I expected 
it to be this time. Better understanding of OOP and ruby made it easy.*
